The course has been a great learning experience. Feels like it is taking a haphazard approach but still heading to a point where everything eventually lines up.
introduction to Git Hub and all its use cases/features have been a great addition to my understanding as well. Quizzes and assignments were all helpful as well in revising all previous knowledge I had about programming and stuff.

I was really expecting to implement Linux in the course outline but so far what we have studied, compliments most, if not completely, of that expectation. 
Again, the approach for quizzes and assignments has been pretty helpful and very new to me. Can't say if I don't like it lol

The only thing left to get my hold on is this Github usage and application. I have still o grasp on it mainly coz there is no purpose for this at the moment in general but would really like to deep dive into this. 

This would have been the final feedback at the end of the session but that's what I understand I have to do here for the fork testing xD

With my understanding, a new fork for the parent file/repo will be an alternate version of this file (which can be distinguished with names of course) and I can just put a pull request for any of the versions I see fit.
