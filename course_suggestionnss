Suggestions regarding the Course:

Course has been going in a very decent direction, content wise. The file handling concept is relatively interesting concept for me as I am familiar with this since I have covered similar approaches using Perl in my
bachelors. 
Really looking forward to exploring more in File handling in the course.

Other thing that Ii would be intrested in covering or learning is the visual aspects of python. 
i have some introduction to that but have not gone in much depth in that direction. 

  Overall, however it goes scores wise, course has been good so far and i think its going at the right pace as well!
